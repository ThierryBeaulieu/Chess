# Chess ♖ ♘ ♗ ♕ ♔ ♗ ♘ ♖

Welcome to this Chess project!

## Installation
The project depends on [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/). For beginners, CMake can be use to general Visual Studio solutions, projects for XCode, Makefiles, etc. You can generate and build your project from the platform that you want. I recommend you download the CMake GUI (it makes things that much easier!). Once you're done with that bit, you should also download or fork this github repository. 

If you are using the CMake GUI, you need to select the root folder of this very repository as your CMake workspace. After that, you need to specify the location of the build folder (this can be anywhere on your computer, but I recommend you keep it somewhat close, as this is where the generated files will end up). The last thing that you need to do is to specify your project's configuration. You should have a Chess game working on your computer.

## Roadmap
The project is currently under development. The general roadmap of the project is the following one.
1. Create a working C++ project (Model)
2. Create a view in React (View)
3. Use WebAssembly and JavaScript to link the model and the view (Controller)
