# Installation

Welcome 👋 to this chess project! If you want to install this project, you can clone it on your computer with:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/ThierryBeaulieu/Chess
```

Before continuating, you will need to install a couple of prerequisites 📖. 

&middot; [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
&middot; [CMake and its GUI](https://cmake.org/install/)
&middot; [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Once that this is done ✔️, you should good to go! You will now be able to proceed to the installation 🚀

If you are on mac or linux, you should use the command:
```bat
Chess> python3 installation.py
```

If you are on Windows, you might not need to specify python's version. You can use this command:
```bat
Chess> python installation.py
```

Now that this is done ✔️, Flask's server will need dynamic libraries generated by C++ . You will need to generate those 🩹. For that, you will need to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/). For the beginners, CMake can be used to generate Visual Studio solutions (Windows) and projects for XCode (Mac). You can generate and build your project from the platform that you want. I recommend you to download the CMake GUI if possible (it makes things that much easier!).

If you are using the CMake GUI, you need to select as a root 🌳 :

```bat
Chess/
```

After that, you need to specify the location of the build folder 🏗️ (this can be anywhere on your computer, but I recommend you keep it somewhat close, as this is where the generated files will end up). Let's say:

```bat
Chess/build/
```
The dynamic libraries are in the folder ```build/server/cpplib/Debug```. There should be .exp, lib and .pyd files. Take those and manually place them in the folder ```Chess/build/server/cppBin/```. 

You should be good to go! To activate the server 🖥️ simply do the command:

```bat
Chess/server/flask> python3 app.py
```

The server should be running 🏃. You will now need to run the front-end with the command:

```bat
Chess/client> npm start
```
Open your browser ⬆️ to ```localhost:5001``` and you should be good to go! If you want to learn more about the different ways that you can contribute, I invite you to click on this link: [Documentation[]()](https://github.com/ThierryBeaulieu/Chess/blob/dev/Documentation.md)
